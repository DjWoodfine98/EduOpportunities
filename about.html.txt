        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I am Devon Woodfine, the creator of EduOpportunities. I am a passionate advocate for education and
            believe
            in the power of scholarships to transform lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am pursuing a Computer Science degree at Cal Poly Pomona. My goal is to make scholarship information
            easily accessible to students seeking financial assistance for their education.

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
            I started EduOpportunities as a way to share valuable scholarship opportunities and help others navigate
            the
            often overwhelming process of finding financial support for their academic journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            Join me in this quest for knowledge and opportunity. Let's make education accessible to everyone!
